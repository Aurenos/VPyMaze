DESCRIPTION

VPyMaze is a 2D maze generation and solving program written
in Python, and rendered in 3D with the Visual Python module.

REQUIREMENTS

To run the program, you must have installed Python 2.7.2
and the Visual Python module, which you can download for
Windows here:
http://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html

I haven't tested this with OSX or Linux based systems yet,
but theoretically it should work fine.

USING PROGRAM SETTINGS IN MAIN.PY
I've conveniently placed all the basic settings for the program
in the main.py file near the beginning of the program
(denoted with a comment). You can edit these to make the program
run however you wish (it should be fairly self-explanatory what
each variable controls).
