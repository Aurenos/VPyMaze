DESCRIPTION

VPyMaze is a 2D maze generation and solving program written
in Python, and rendered in 3D with the Visual Python module.
Depending on the settings of the program, the maze's 
generation will animate, and then either solve itself
or allow the user to solve manually with the arrow keys.

REQUIREMENTS

To run the program, you must have installed Python 2.7.x
and the Visual Python module, which you can download for
Windows here:
http://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html

If you're on Ubuntu, just make sure your Python version
is 2.7.x and run the following two commands:

sudo apt-get install python-visual
sudo apt-get install libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev

USING PROGRAM SETTINGS IN SETTINGS.PY
I've conveniently placed all the basic settings for the program
in the settings.py file. You can edit these to make the program
run however you wish (it should be fairly self-explanatory what
each variable controls).
